                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>FSor this assignment, students were asked to choose an IT technology topic and provide research on its applications. The topic which will be discussed from a civil engineering perspective is the UAV drone. As the key discussion is based on civil engineering, some examples on how a delivery modelled drone could be used in a variety of civil transportation-based industries will be explored. Furthermore, the technological developments in the autonomous UAV will be discussed as well as certain models and their perspective fields. Lastly, the questions mentioned in the rubric will be addressed using a literature review format. As the team decided on designing a game, some kinematics-based drone application such as polygon path finding strategies will be introduced in the literature review on 3D model integrations.</p>
<br>
                <h2>Significance</h2>
                <p>Air travel has been innovated thoroughly in today’s modern world, progressing in many areas including fully automated machines. A leading invention that begun as military usage (Glade, 2000), expanding its utility in other industries such as film, travel and data mapping is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also labelled aerial drones (Boucher, 2016, Beard et al., 2005). Abundant research has been developed on means the drone can aid different industries, revealing to be more environmentally friendly, lowering carbon dioxide emissions and an overall net positive in cost efficiency. Furthermore, economists believe that soon if the UAV technology grows its market trends, conventional transportation costs today will become higher than the drone’s (Jang et al., 2020). Thus, this literature review aims to discusses the impact drones have had on industries such as transportation of information and goods. The report will identify key components the UAV has improved from previous practise, focusing on three important topics. The first will introduce airborne delivery methods advancements with respects to future improvements. The second aims to identify smart AI transportation routing, adopting mobile crowd sensing methods. The third will discuss routing distance the UAV can achieve, using artificial neural network or nonlinear programming to find the fastest pathway. With the aid of the topics mentioned, the applications should help highlight how smart AI in drones are used to solve key transportation issues. In other words, on how the current state on the UAV could improve upon current transport practises. Therefore, highlighting its future possibility if further developments are continued to overtake modern transportation methods.
                </p>

<br>
                <h2>Application 1- The UAV’s Airborne Delivery Strategies  </h2>
                <p>In countries today, the most common method of travel is using a four-wheel vehicle. Such domestic delivery approach accounts for a large proportion of their perspective GDP. The current transportation industry has illustrated trends of contributing heavily to CO2 gas emissions from overcrowded vehicles on roads (Steenland et al., 1990). Also, long exposure to diesel fuel and travel expenses illustrates as unhealthy for drivers (Steenland et al., 1998). In comparison, the UAV aims to provide a better greenhouse footprint. Such advantage of using the drone could be especially important on remote regions. For example, Rwanda’s mountain’s terrain where road is non-existent. An experiment was conducted in the region for first production-level use of blood via Zipline’s fixed-wing delivery drone. The test illustrated a decrease in total sum costs when comparing alternative ground transportation methods when crossing such terrain (Simmons, 2016). Although this was shown as a good method for meeting less greenhouse emissions, some modifications may be needed to deal with weight limitation the smaller frame UAV faces when airborne (Mozaffari et al., 2019). To do so, smart AI could be considered to balance the weight based on certain altitudes. Good designs such as fixed wing, single rotor, Quad pus, X shaped copter, Hexa copter and Octo copter should be investigated when deciding on the UAV to be built (Mogili and Deepak, 2018). Advantages of longer flight distance and miles coverage in remote areas is desired when performing deliveries in such remote places. The drone development could incorporate a good communication network in case of emergencies by hovering over larger areas (Paredes et al., 2017). Therefore, highlighting a different approach to aim for improving upon the four-wheel transportation methods.
                </p>
<br>
                <h2>Application 2- MCS for 3D Mapping Possibilities  </h2>
                <p>Using the UAV, high quality surveys can be performed using 3D mapping and aerial photography with a bird’s eye view from ground level captures (Yanmaz et al., 2018). By doing so, the arial drone prepare and plan out the possible travel routes in its journey. For example, in routing computations, many new models have highlighted accurate spatial coverage around non-flat surfaces (Tkáč and Mésároš, 2019). This is illustrated using Mobile Crowed Sensing (MCS). Where MCS allows for instantaneous data collection with a great efficiency of fast deployment and controllable spatial mobility (Zhou et al., 2018). Mobile crowed sensing is most acted best when direction is parallel to the smallest linear dimension, leading to an increase time efficiency the aerial drone can capture its surroundings (Avellar et al., 2015). However, if wind direction and speed are subjected to change, flying against the wind may disrupt the drone, resulting in inaccuracies of routing computations using the sensors (Gupta et al., 2015). Even when considering these restraints, mapping using UAV MCS sensos in certain altitudes shown effectiveness in creating 3D models with multi captures for special information. When discussing building a video game, such terrain 3D mapped models could be explored are redesigned for in house illustrations (Drone Pilot Ground School, 2017), Hence, highlighting the possible usability of the drone in areas such as 3D mapping.
                </p>
<br>
                <h2>Application 3- Travel Design for Shortest Pathway </h2>
                <p>Once the arial drone finishes analysing its surroundings, the correct routed path can be identified using continuous motion nonlinear programming (Borrelli et al., 2006). Adopting carbon fibre microdrones, full dataset imaging was able to be processed for the information recorded. Thus, the UAV was able to find the best scaled geo-referenced 3D neural path network (Nex and Remondino, 2013). This system is illustrated when the UAV was applied in open-pit mines topographical surveying. The arial drone was able to understand its terrain by instigating 3D mapping of the rock slopes discontinuous surface faces (Lee and Choi, 2015). Another example of similar insights into monitoring dust particles at open-pit mines in occasion to its blast was conducted. With the aid of a UAV fixed-wing drones, topographic surveys at open-pit limestone mines was investigated (Alvarado et al., 2015). As the UAVs altitude rose above the mining site using smart sensors, it allowed the arial drone to avoid atmospheric obstacles in the open pits. These included yellow sand clouds, which satellites and airplanes find difficult to spatially learn and derive information in such altitudes (Lee and Choi, 2016). Moreover, integrating machine learning Artificial Neural Network methods for automation is shown improvements in the UAV performance. Calculations in what elevations the UAV could perform, considering the arial drones’ weight into best results for landing. Using machine learning, the UAV enabled smart routing using 3D mapping to determine the best flight action in the physical airborne testing site (Guo et al., 2014). In terms of the UAV human risk involved, the arial drone completed its objective without falling into any dangers present. Therefore, showing the capabilities of a fixed- wing arial drone (Goerzen et al., 2010). Hence, highlighting the actions taken into achieving the best autonomous path solutions.

                <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
                <h2>What is their likely impact?</h2>
                <p>Today’s modern world is moving towards atomising every industry, causing certain jobs to be conducted in a faster more efficient manner. With the rise of autonomous machines, it could lead to a new age of the third industrial revolution known as the AI revolution. In these times certain jobs that use mutual labour or pure people-based skills are subjected to change. Whether that may be a complete overall of the jobs qualification or a slight adjustment, changes in most industries will occur. New jobs that look after and mange autonomous machines may become a popular sector within the existing economy worldwide as it should lead to an overall increase in production and desired product outcome. If most autonomous vehicles can be as efficient as modern-day transportations the redundancy of the same jobs could in the future become redundant. Although, this development can only occur if the technology is being invested and tested for a long period of time before it can be commercialised. As so far, these autonomous vehicles are still in early commercial production, more resources are required to completely change how the current industry functions between companies and consumers. As mentioned in the significance, the idea that this industry will change domestically is still in development. However, if the technology would be developed in areas such as the UAV, many people across the globe would find an easier access to goods and services. As mentioned in the applications of arial drones, by using 3D mapping most people could have a real time view through virtual means. However, if UAV are going to be prevalent in most communities, flight restrictions as well as flight permits should be implemented to manage the future large volume of air traffic with respect to property privacy. This will ensure that the companies and consumers will be able to interact homogeneously amongst one another.

                <h2>How will this affect you?  </h2>
                <p>For me, I graduate university at the end of this semester. If I do choose to peruse a career in civil engineering, I would most likely have to work with autonomous systems. These include the examples mentioned with the UAV in the literature review and can be expanded into other fields in civil engineering. A standard action that utilises autonomous vehicles is testing materials maximum bending moments and shear forces. By forcing different materials such as concrete, steel and wood under certain conditions, the best material in terms of strength relative to cost should be chosen. If these experiments where to be done autonomously, it could be more systematically understood better than a personal tester as no human error could occur, limiting mistakes during the review process until the materials breaking point. Furthermore, if a similar autonomous systems using 3D mapping and motion sensors, site visits would be deemed unnecessary as any issue could be recorded using building information modelling in real time. In terms of daily life, from a consumer’s perspective, if deliveries of goods and services were conducted fully autonomously, it would progressively make accurate decisions to deliver goods on time. Also, with good management applications, I would be able to choose when the deliveries are made instead of being dependent on the company I’m consuming from. Although these changes appear overall positive, I do believe that the human interaction that would be lost could make such interactions of receiving goods less humane. As the world continues to become more machine and human, I find myself that with less interactions amongst people being an overall negative in consumer experience, as the individual is very much dependent on the machine AI rather than other people. Even if autonomous vehicles could lead to a more coinvent lifestyle in the short term, it may create separation amongst friends and family in the long term due to that dependency on autonomous machines. Therefore, a good balance that incorporate human interactions and AI interactions should be considered when looking into future industries. </p>

              <h1 style=color:Darkred;> Single Board Computers (SBC’s) </h1>
              <h>By Anin Cotton</h>

              <p></p>

              <h2>What is a Single Board Computer (SCB)?</h2>
              <p>Single Board Computers (SBCs), or small computing devices, are small self-contained computers that have all major components located and directly embedded onto a single circuit board (e.g. CPU, RAM-memory, graphics chip, storage, input/output ports). SBCs therefore differentiate from personal computers (PCs) to which components are separate modules and are not directly connected to the circuit board (Technopedia 2017).
                SBCs vary greatly possessing various uses and capabilities, with the physical device itself ranging in size but generally fitting into the palm of a hand.
                The simple and compact form factor of SBCs make them reliable, power-efficient and very affordable compared to normal computers. However, this comes at the cost of processing power, speed, as well as limited software capability (Bae Systems 2022; Technopedia 2017). For this reason, SBCs are generally used for small-scale projects, tasks and/or educational purposes, but also play a significant role in industrial sectors (Manz 2020).
                The SBC market itself has grown exponentially in recent years with many manufacturers producing their own unique SBCs, creating a diverse range of SBCs fitted with differing board components and general use purposes (Ortmeyer 2014). Notable manufacturers in the SBC market include Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard, Arduino, Makey-Makey, etc.
              </p>
<br>
              <h2>What is it used for?</h2>
              <p>As mentioned, SBCs have a multitude of uses, but generally serve the purpose of running code or an operating system (e.g. Linux) which has been uploaded onto the device. This, in addition to their size and cost make SCBs very applicable and practical for industrial usage, often adding additional computing intelligence to industrial devices (Alves 2019; Manz 2020).
                SBCs can be seen across almost every industry sector with applications in consumer goods, smart-home, automotive, medical, commercial and even military sectors (Bae Systems 2022). Specific examples of SBC usage in industry may include, but are definitely not limited to use in Point of Sales (POS) registers, edge computing, robotics, medical devices, traffic light controllers, cell phones, automotive anti-lock braking, medical imaging systems, missile guiding systems, data centres, etc. (Bae Systems 2022; Johnston et al. 2018).</p>
            <p>    Outside of their industrial use, SBCs also have a strong presence in the consumer markets. Often hobbyists, or people interested in IT use SBCs for an endless amount of DIY computing projects. These may include making IoT devices (e.g. internet connected appliances), media players, sensors, automation of devices (e.g. smart home functions), small robots, gaming systems, and more (Manz 2020; MARÍN-MARÍN et al. 2020). </p>
              <p>  Momentarily exploring SBCs and gaming, SBCs are often used by consumers to run low demanding games. Whilst SBCs don’t have the processing power to run high-end games they provide a cost effective and portable device that can be programmed to run many retro game ROMS through a number of console emulators. For example, the popular emulator ‘RetroPi’ is often installed onto Raspberry Pi SBCs and is capable of emulating almost every game from the SNES, NES, N64 up to the Gameboy, DS and even Wii consoles (Shubham 2021). This capability of SBCs also has large potential for our group’s ‘Project Idea’ (a 2d top-down shooter game), allowing us an additional platform to not only test our game, but to be used as the console to showcase our game to show interested individuals, or alternatively housed within a SCB run arcade machine of sorts.</p>
              <p>  Finally, SBCs also play a significant role in education as a terrific way for individuals and students to build, learn and see the direct and real-world effects that coding/programming can have, often demonstrated through simple circuitry, computing, and robotics projects. SBCs like the Makey-Makey serve purely educational purposes, allowing students to explore circuitry through forming simple circuits out of ordinary household objects, through converting basic electrical signals into direct computer inputs (MARÍN-MARÍN et al. 2020).
              </p>
<br>
              <h2>What can we expect in the near future? </h2>
              <p>Given current progress, soon we can expect to see numerous developments in SBC technologies. These devices will not only be more powerful in their processing capabilities and speeds, but will further decrease in size, require smaller bandwidths, gain improved software support, become even more affordable and slowly become more popular and accepted as their use increases within society and our lives (Ortmeyer 2014). </p>
              <p>  The technological developments that make this possible surround the advancements that will inevitably occur in the power/speed of computer processing and hardware that we continue to see (Ortmeyer 2014; Markoff 2015). Furthermore, the growing demand and exposure SBCs receive will drive companies to compete to develop greater, more innovative, and affordable SBCs. Also, as we continue towards a highly technologically integrated society and industry becomes increasingly automated this too facilitates development in SBC technology to occur. Finally, the breadth and access to knowledge and education surrounding SBCs also works to enable these developments and overall SBC awareness.
              </p>

  <br>

              <h2>Wider SCB Developments and Future Impacts</h2>
              <p>These previously mentioned developments are likely to have large-scale impacts on many aspects of society and industry. For instance, as hardware and computing power technologies develop and allow for faster speeds, improved software and more processing capabilities, SBCs will thus be able to expand beyond the scope of their currently limited use (Burgess 2017). This means SBCs eventually will have the power and functionality of many PCs we have today, yet still within its small physical form-factor.</p>
                <p>As a result we can expect to see extremely powerful mobile devices, laptops and more capable of things we are currently limited to doing on a PC (Personal Computers) due to the technological limitations. Furthermore, we can also expect these developments to open the doors for the introduction of powerful wearables, such as smart glasses and the furthering of mobile VR (Virtual Reality) and AR (Augmented Reality) technology (Ennis-Cole 2022).</p>
              <p>  Industry will likely see a large increase in the automation and efficiency of work through increased use of smart and powerful SBC powered robots, which have the potential to cause physical labour to be made redundant as companies’ transition (Harbert n.d.). However, this increase in SBC integration will also see a rise in jobs elsewhere given human labour will be needed to manufacture, program, install, monitor and repair said SBC-driven devices (Casey & Nzau 2019). SBCs in industry will also streamline workplace productivity and processes, such as through edge computing (removing the bandwidth delay in the relay of data for the function of a device connected to a distant server/processing unit), and mitigate many workplace issues that stem from human error (e.g. WH&S incidents) (Hillard 2020; Johnston et al. 2018; Mulder 2020).
                As the cost of SCBs decreases, accessibility will increase to a wider audience effecting overall SCB device usage and integration in society, thus increasing SCB development/innovation and regularity (Dahlqvist et al. 2019). </p>
              <p>  Continued decrease in overall size will see SBCs at the forefront of the nano-technologies sector of the future. This will see powerful computers small enough to be swallowed, revolutionary for the medical field given its potential to improve and save the lives of many. An example of such being ingestible computer pills that diagnose issues from inside the body, to devices that can automatically regulate blood-sugar levels of diabetics, etc (NPR 2015).
              </p>
<br>
              <h2>Individual Effects</h2>
              <p>On the individual level this would affect multiple areas of both my own life and of those around me. Given its effects on the workforce, SBC developments would improve workflow and productivity for many (like myself) with more portable and powerful computers in the workplace, thereby further mobilising work (Harris-Briggs 2018).</p>
              <p>  However, for many people I know working labour intensive warehousing jobs SBCs may facilitate the transition to smart robots and automation of work which could leave these individuals without work. On the other hand, this same SBC development shows much promise for my friends pursing IT as future prospects continue to grow (e.g. Programming skills) (Hargrave 2018).</p>
                SBC integration in the home and the heavy use of IoT devices in the future will make my personal systems and devices (e.g. home appliances) much easier to handle and control remotely, which also has added safety and convenience implications (Ortmeyer 2014).
              <p>  Furthermore, the previously mentioned innovations in healthcare SBCs possess can have huge effects for health and life quality of the entire human race.</p>
            <p>    Yet given SBC development will consequently drive much of the surrounding technological innovations, we must remain aware of its impact on the technological divide of society, especially regarding AR and VR technologies. With powerful SBC driven computers and wearables on our persons at all times, society will have no barriers to instantaneously accessing the virtual realm, thus we must strive to ensure future technologies continue to facilitate connection rather than separation. </p>
              <p>  Although small, SCBs are set to have a huge impact on our industries, society and world merging technology and the human race closer than ever before.

            <h1 style=color:Darkred;>Cybersecurity</h1>
            <h>By Altaf Hossain</h>

            <p></p>

            <h2>What Is Cyber-Security & What does it do?</h2>
            <p> Cybersecurity refers to the safeguarding of internet-connected systems, including hardware, software, and data, from cyber threats. Individuals and businesses utilize this method to prevent illegal access to data centers and other digital systems (CISCO, n.d.). </p>
            <p>  A strong cyber security can provide a good security posture against malicious attacks designed to access, alter, delete, destroy, or export an organization's or user's systems and sensitive data. Cybersecurity is also instrumental in preventing attacks that aim to disable or disrupt a system's or device's operations. </p>
            <p>  Cybersecurity is one of the important infrastructures of Information Technology. Which has a few subdomains that include Critical infrastructure security, Network security, Application security Cloud security, Information security, Storage security, Mobile security ETC (IBM, n.d.).</p>
              <p> Yet the usage of cyber security is not limited. As we are virtualizing every object the importance of cyber security is correlating with it. The biggest future impact of cyber security will be in crypto currency, internet banking, virtual gaming, and Artificial Intelligence. </p>
            <p>  Cybersecurity & Cryptocurrency: is a new form of money that functions in a vastly unusual way compared to the traditional currency we all use daily. The most fundamental distinction is that it is solely virtual money, which means there are no actual bitcoin coins or notes to carry around in your wallet.
              It is also issued or generated in a one-of-a-kind manner. New cryptocurrency units often enter circulation through a technological process that requires the cooperation of volunteers from all over the world using their computers, rather than being produced by a central bank or government, as U.S (United States). dollars, euros, and other fiat currencies are.
              The popularity of crypto has increased tenfold in the past few years & there is no sign of any downward trend. It is noticeably clear that cryptocurrencies will play an incredibly significant role in the upcoming years & Cybersecurity plays a vital role in securing & maintaining crypto (Muath A. Obaidat, Joseph Brown 2021). </p>
            <p>  Cybersecurity in Internet Banking: In banking, the fundamental goal of cyber security is to protect the user's assets. Further acts or transactions are done online as people go cashless. Individuals use digital money, such as debit and credit cards, for transactions that must be protected by cyber security (Intelipaat, 2022).
              Cyber security is not only crucial for IT (Information Technology) companies; it is also important for every business. However, it is extremely valuable to banks. Daily, banks handle millions of transactions. As a result, it is critical for banks to implement defensive security protocols to protect their data from cyber threats.</p>

            <p>  Cybersecurity & Artificial Intelligence: Artificial intelligence (AI) is assisting under-resourced security operations analysts in staying ahead of threats as cyberattacks expand in volume and complexity. AI technologies like machine learning and natural language processing curate threat intelligence from millions of research papers, blogs, and news stories, providing instant insights to cut through the noise of daily alerts and lowering response times. (IBM, n.d.) </p>
            <p>  Cybersecurity & Online Gaming: Although the industry and stakeholders have deployed various security defenses, including an anti-cheat system, many organizations are running bug bounty programs.
              An anti-cheat system checks the suspicious players by performing a whole memory scan, process analysis, code inspection, etc. They ban the player from the platform even if they find a web search with “cheat.”
              In January 2019, Valve Corporation, developer of Dota 2, CS GO, and Steam, banned more than 1 million accounts with the help of the Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) system. Similarly, the Counterstrike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) player known as “Forsaken” was banned for five years after being caught using an Aimbots during a tournament in 2018. (Mina Aryal, 2020).
            </p>
<br>
            <h2>What is the impact of Cyber Security? </h2>
            <p> Cybercrime is becoming more than ever a significant issue. Cybercrime is estimated to cost more than $6 trillion (about $18,000 per person in the US) by 2021, (Steve Morgan, 2019) and cyber thieves are becoming more daring in their targets. Recently, even the healthcare industry has been targeted. However, as cybercrime has become more prevalent, so has security awareness. The cyber security industry has played a key role in providing individuals and businesses with the information they require to better combat cybercrime. With the necessary abilities and education, people might join this industry. </p>
<br>
            <h3> More businesses are encrypting data </h3>
            <p>Data encryption is a fundamental aspect of cyber protection that many businesses have previously overlooked. However, an increasing number of businesses are employing corporate encryption solutions to secure sensitive data from unauthorized access. </p>
<br>
            <h3> Authentication with multiple factors is becoming more common </h3>
            <p> User accounts cannot be accessed without their permission thanks to multi-factor authentication. Before logging in, users must provide further confirmation of their identification, usually by inputting a code sent to them via email, SMS, or an application. Multi-factor authentication is increasingly widely used, frequently with extra security features such as access codes that expire after a few minutes or are only valid for one use. </p>
<br>
            <h2>How will cyber security impact the job sector?</h2>
            <p>
              Cybersecurity specialists have a wide range of work opportunities. Working in cybersecurity will provide those seeking an epic career in 2025 with competitive pay and the opportunity to work with innovative technologies. Employers are willing to pay high salaries to employees whose data is protected because of these facts.
              According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employers will be hiring more cybersecurity professionals between now and 2029, or 31% more jobs than the other industries combined. Most other industries will not be able to keep up with that pace.
              privacy and data-centric security will become one of the defining characteristics of cybersecurity, due to the surge of cybercrime. By adopting technologies to enhance user privacy, users will be able to protect their essential data assets. (Cathy, n.d.)
            </p>

<br>
            <h2> How will this affect us? </h2>
            <p> Every device and orifice that connects to the internet now has cyber security built in. But why should we care about this — and how does it affect our everyday lives? </p>
<br>
            <h3> 1.) Protect yourself and your computer from harmful files. </h3>
            <p> When you visit some websites, you run the risk of getting infected with harmful programmes that wish to steal your personal information. You can still visit sites that the system deems "safe to visit" or do not contain any hazardous files if you follow correct cyber security protocols. When it detects a threat, however, it will block the website. </p>
<br>
            <h3> 2.) Protect yourself from identity theft. </h3>
            <p> "Why would somebody want to take my identity?" you might ask. What are they getting out of it?" As it turns out, quite a bit.
                You may be opening yourself up to a world of debt and costs unlike anything you have ever seen if cyber attackers get their hands on your legal name, birthday, e-mail address, and other essential information. Hackers and internet thugs can impersonate you, and their victim may misinterpret their previous behavior as yours. They can also use this information to build accounts on other sites and fool individuals you know if they have access to it.
                </p>
<br>
            <h3> 3.) Prevent critical information from leaking. </h3>
            <p> Cybercriminals can gain access to sensitive information and share it with the rest of the world if cyber security is compromised. It could be in the form of clear photographs or personal information, but it is still a lose-lose situation at best. </p>
<br>
            <h3> 4.) Protect yourself from ransomware assaults. </h3>
            <p> Ransomware, a sort of malware that encrypts a user's computer until they pay the virus's owner a set sum of money (typically in untraceable Bitcoin format), has been on the rise. This growth has occurred in lockstep with the rise of bitcoin in recent months. Cyber security rules can keep a system from downloading and installing software that could contain this hazardous infection. </p>
<br>
            <h3> 5.) Virus protection for other systems. </h3>
            <p> A computer virus spreads by infecting one system and then transmitting it to another via file transfers and other means, like how viruses spread in real life. Though the channel via which they are transmitted has developed, the method of transmission remains the same – which can be mitigated with a good cyber security system; remember, prevention is always preferable to cure – in a variety of situations. </p>

              <h1 style=color:Darkred;> Clouds, Services & Servers </h1>

              <h> By Kelvin Nguyen </h>
<br>
<br>
              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Cloud technology is defined as “a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand
                  network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly
                  provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction”
                  (Peter Mell; Timothy Grance, 2011). </p>
                <p>
                  In summary, cloud computing is the use of remote networks to store and manage data
                  instead of local means (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004).</p>
<br>
              <h3>Characteristics of Cloud Computing</h3>
              <p>Cloud computing is made up of five essential characteristics, which are ‘on-demand self
                  service’, ‘broad network access’, ‘resource pooling’, ‘rapid elasticity’ and ‘measured service’.
                  (Peter Mell; Timothy Grance, 2011) On-demand self service is the ability for users
                  themselves to be able to use services and resources without the need for human interaction
                  from the cloud service provider. Broad network access is having access for resources to be
                  available and accessible over the internet using various devices from anywhere that there is
                  internet access. Resource pooling is to have all cloud resources pooled into one area to
                  serve multiple users. Rapid elasticity is the ease of scaling resources up or down at any
                  time. Measured service is the automatic control and optimisation of resources using a
                  metering capability (Mohammad Ilyas Malik; Shahid Hussain Wani; Abreen Rashid 2018)
                  and (Peter Mell; Timothy Grance, 2011).</p>
<br>
              <h3>Deployment Models of Cloud Computing</h3>
              <p> Cloud computing has different types of deployment models, which are private, public, hybrid,
                  and community. A private cloud is a cloud infrastructure that is only for the exclusive use of
                  one organisation, which is managed by the organisation. A community cloud is a cloud
                  infrastructure that is in use by specific communities from multiple organisations. A public
                  cloud is a cloud infrastructure that is open to be used by the general public. A hybrid cloud is
                  a cloud infrastructure that is made up of public, private and community clouds where critical
                  activity is done in private clouds and non-critical activity is done in public clouds
                  (Mohammad Ilyas Malik; Shahid Hussain Wani; Abreen Rashid 2018), (Peter Mell; Timothy
                  Grance, 2011).</p>
<br>
              <h3>Service Models of Cloud Computing</h3>
              <p>Cloud computing also contains three different types of service models, which are Software
                  as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
                  SaaS are cloud computing services provided to users in the form of an application hosted on
                  a cloud service, an example of this would be Google Apps such as Google Drive. PaaS are
                  services that allow users to create their own SaaS to host an example would be Windows
                  Azure. IaaS are cloud computing services that provide storage and networking resources, an
                  example would be Amazon EC2 (Mohammad Ilyas Malik; Shahid Hussain Wani; Abreen
                  Rashid 2018).</p>
<br>
              <h3>State of the Art Technology in Cloud Computing</h3>
              <p>The most prominent industry in cloud computing would be Google, and their Google cloud
                    technology.</p>
              <p>With the rise of Covid-19, Google Cloud has offered many services to assist people and
                        communities all over the world. Google Meet, a video conferencing tool was widely used
                        during the pandemic, with the usage increasing by 60%, assisting the job and education
                        sectors, in addition Google has implemented more features in Google Meet and made it
                        available to South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia and South Africa to assist usage of
                        educational institutions due to the rise of Covid (Thomas Kurian 2020).</p>
              <p>Google cloud services were also able to help public sector agencies fight Covid-19. Google
                      was able to develop AI based chat technology to assist agencies to respond quickly to
                      citizen requests to provide more time for government agencies for other services. They have
                      also worked with the Australian Government Department of Health to launch the Coronavirus
                      Australia App. Google is also working with agencies such as the Oklahoma State
                      Department of Health to provide means for medical staff to engage remotely with at-risk
                      people (Thomas Kurian 2020).</p>
              <p>Research and healthcare have also been assisted by Google’s cloud services. This has

              <h3>The future of cloud computing</h2>
              <p>As cloud computing is being widely utilised, the technology as a whole will also evolve with
                    its usages. </p>
                <p>    The future of cloud computing will see improved safety as more threats to cloud services
                    arise, the use of artificial intelligence, algorithms, and quantum computing will be mainly
                    used to combat threats and develop security measures (Tech Journal 2022). </p>
                  <p>  Many companies have considered the use of open source cloud services as it enables
                    companies to easily modify systems to fit the specific needs of the companies. Open source
                    cloud services also minimise security risks while also providing custom functionality, which
                    may assist in the growth of a company’s network infrastructure (Tech Journal 2022). </p>
                  <p>  Economically, while the cloud computing technology continues to grow, the use of hardware
                    systems will decrease due to data moving towards the cloud. In the future, data on the cloud
                    may also be examined by a computer without the need for human intervention (Tech Journal
                    2022).</p>

              <h2> What is the likely impact?</h2>
                <h3>Industries that have been impacted by cloud computing</h3>
              <p>Many industries have been impacted by cloud computing, the most notable industries that
                          have been impacted are the Financial industry, the Healthcare industry and the Education
                          industry. </p>
                        <p>  The average financial institution has more than 58% of its workload in the cloud. JP Morgan
                          and Goldman Sachs are examples of bank companies that utilise cloud computing for their
                          benefit. Cloud computing is essential to the financial institution because of the massive
                          amounts of data that is constantly being created, whether it’s billing information, or stock
                          trades (Srushti Shah 2022).</p>
                        <p>  In the Healthcare industry, with the rise of Covid-19 have seen a large shift in healthcare
                          institutions adopting services in the cloud. Examples of the usage of cloud technology in
                          healthcare would be the remote monitoring of patients using devices and long distance
                          conferences using video cloud services. It is predicted that cloud computing in healthcare
                          will be worth $64.6 billion by 2026 in the USA, with 83% of health care sectors using cloud
                          computing, despite this, 93% of cloud services used by American healthcare faces medium
                          to high security risks (Srushti Shah 2022). </p>
                        <p>  The education industry widely utilising cloud technology made it easy for people to access.
                          Remote learning has been incorporated into normal everyday study allowing an alternative
                          to face to face studying during the pandemic. Cloud services have also led some institutions
                          to transition from paperback learning material to online ones as schools have adopted
                          devices such as tablets and laptops into education. Events such as Massive Open Online
                          Courses (MOOCs) have also become normalised, with 120 million learners in 2019 (Srushti
                          Shah 2022).</p>
                        <p>  Hardware has also been impacted by cloud technology. Now that services are offering cloud
                          based data storage, hardware such as data centres, on-premise servers, and even hard
                          drives have been replaced by cloud technology, such as google drive and dropbox offering
                          terabytes worth or storage (TruTechnology 2021; Thomas Kurian 2022; Drew Houston
                          2022).</p>
<br>
                      <h2> How will this affect you?</h2>

                      <p>The development of cloud computing has impacted us greatly, as it is a technology that I and
                      many others utilise on a daily basis. The most impactful cloud services that the majority of
                      the population uses are seen in education, social, healthcare, navigation, and personal
                      storage. For education, the use of cloud services to share documents and attend classes
                      remotely have been extremely useful for me as I have used Google drive from the beginning
                      of year 7 till now in order to complete tasks and share documents, I was also able to
                      complete my VCE years using Zoom and Google meets, now in university still use these
                      services but with the addition of Microsoft Teams, RMIT Canvas, and Microsoft Outlook. An
                      example of a social aspect that cloud technology impacted would be online communications
                      which the use Discord has assisted in, which has allowed me to communicate to friends
                      remotely. I also utilise healthcare services in Australia, which have all of my information
                      stored online, which has assisted me in filling out documents and allowing for appointment
                      attendances. When travelling, navigational apps such as Google maps and PTV containing
                      gps and map data have been proven extremely useful. In the past running out of storage has
                      been resolved multiple times using services such as Google Drive to store files. Cloud
                      computing has also assisted my friends and family, as the technology is widely used in
                      various industries, which has overall increased due to the pandemic.</p>

                      <h2>Uses of Cloud Services in gaming </h2>
                                    <h3>How cloud services will be useful in developing the project idea</h3>
                                    <p>When developing the project, cloud computing technology will play a huge role. From the
                      formation of this group, cloud services such as Microsoft Teams, Google Drive and Github
                      have been used to collaborate, and communicate, these services will be further used to
                      develop the project idea. Cloud technology may be also used to store data for the game
                      itself, as services such as Steam saves user data on a cloud server, user data from the
                      game we develop may also be stored on a cloud service for easy retrieval and data
                      recovery, further more services such as Google Stadia also allow for access without
                      downloading by streaming the game itself to users, this may be utilised.</p>
