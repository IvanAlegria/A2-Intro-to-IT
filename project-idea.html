                <h1>Project<span> Idea</span></h1>
                <h>2D top-down shooter game using Unity</h>
                <p>The purpose of this project idea is to use programming languages such as JavaScript or C-sharp to develop a shooter game using the game development tool called Unity. The game will be a “shoot ‘em up” type in which the player combats many enemies by shooting at them whilst dodging their fire.</p><br>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>The motivation to commence this project was mainly my interest and passion for games whether it be a shooter genre, an RPG, if it was 2D or 3D. And by learning how to program, trying to develop a game would be interesting as I would be creating something that I like, along with learning how games are created through coding. Also, due to the lack of experience in game development creating a 2D would be ideal, as not only is it easier to make, but it would also be a great introduction to learn the fundamentals.</p><br>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>As mentioned, the project is a 2D top-down shooter game similar to games such as “Enter the Gungeon” and “Nuclear Throne”. The objective of the game is to collect as many ‘boxes’ whilst fighting hordes of enemies and dodging returning fire. By collecting these ‘boxes’ the player will be accumulating points and will also receive a new random weapon from a pool. As points continue to increase so will the rate at which enemies spawn and how difficult they will be to kill. The final developed game should include the features:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;" class="desc">
                    <li> <i><b> Working player model</b></i></li>
                    <li>o	Player model orientation follows the mouse cursor</li>
                    <li>o	Player model moves when directional keys are pressed</li>
                    <li>o	Model animations; running, idle, damaged, etc.	</li>
                    <li><i><b>Gameplay</b></i></li>
                    <li>o  Can fire gun by clicking the left mouse button</li>	
                    <li>o	Gun shoots towards mouse cursor</li>
                    <li> o	‘Boxes’ are randomly generated throughout the map</li>
                    <li>o	When player picks up a box, the point counter increases</li>
                    <li> o	Boxes disappears when picked up</li>
                    <li> o	Players current weapon is replaced with a random weapon when picking up a box</li>
                    <li> o	Various weapons with different features</li>
                    <li><i><b> Enemies</b></i></li>
                    <li>o	Enemy number of enemies that spawn increases when the point counter goes up</li>
                    <li>o	Different enemy types and health points</li>
                    <li>o	Different enemy attack/shooting patterns</li>
                    <li><i><b>Map</b></i></li>
                    <li>o	Enemies have a set spawn point in the map</li>
                    <li>o	The map has walls in which players can take cover from</li>
                    <li>o	Walls have collision (players can’t walk or shoot through)</li>
                    <li><i><b>Other</b></i></li>
                    <li>o	Gameplay sounds (BGM, gun sounds, hit sounds, etc.)</li>
                
                </ul>
                <br><h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
                <p>To develop the game is mainly Unity, which is a free 2D/3D engine that provides a system for designing games and or applications. This software will be used to program using either C-sharp or JavaScript and run the game itself. Although Unity has an asset store in which users can download free or paid assets that can be imported to the program, Unity does not enable users to model 2D or 3D assets. Therefore software such as Blender or Photoshop will be required to design the player, enemy, gun, effects, and map designs. Audio software such as "Ardour" or "LMMS which are both free and can be used to make the project’s in-game music.</p>
                <br><h3>Skills Required</h3>
                <p>To successfully complete the project, requires a diverse set of skills such as programming knowledge as Unity uses languages like JavaScript, C-sharp, and Boo. Unity is beginner friendly as there are many tutorials they provide as well as a community forum.</p>
                <p>Image, texturing, modelling, and animation skills are needed to create all the in-game assets like player models, map design, and effects. Fortunately, this is fairly easy as I have experience in illustrating, texturing, and animating as an artist.</p>
                <p>Additionally, skills in creating music would be helpful as it plays a big part of games. However, it is not required as various sound assets found online can be implemented into the game and are also free to use.</p>
                <br><h3>Drawbacks</h3>
                <p>The expected drawback when undergoing this project would definitely be the lack of knowledge in game development and programming, especially when using an unfamiliar application like Unity. There will be an initial learning curve when starting off until the process becomes smoother. Bugs and errors may also arise in the process and these have to be fixed to make the game run properly as intended.</p>
                <br><h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>If this project is successful, it should result in a working and playable top-down shooter that is exported as a .exe in the windows platform. Most if not all features previously described should be implemented such as player model orientation, map collision and gunplay. By completing this project should also lead to increased knowledge on how to program using either JavaScript or C-sharp, the fundamentals of game development using Unity, and the other processes required to make a game like modelling, texture, and sound design.</p>
