                <h1>Project<span> Idea</span></h1>
                <h>2D top-down shooter game using Unity</h>
                <p>For this assessment task, groups of students were tasked to develop an IT project idea and expand on the plans our group will take in order to make the idea a reality for the upcoming assignment. The idea we plan develop is a ‘2d top-down shooter game using Unity’. The purpose of this project idea is to use programming languages such as JavaScript or C-sharp to develop a shooter game using the game development tool called Unity. The game will be a “shoot ‘em up” type in which the player combats many enemies by shooting at them whilst dodging their fire. 

                <p> game would be placed in the ‘top-down’ genre (top-down shooters specifically) and positioned to target a specific audience who like fast-paced and bullet hell style games. For example, games such as “Nuclear Throne”, “Binding of Isaac”, and “Vampire Survivors” which are popular for its difficulty, rouge-like gameplay and is also known to be some of the best-selling games in the genre.</p>
                    </p><br>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>The motivation to commence this project was mainly my interest and passion for games whether it be a shooter genre, an RPG, if it was 2D or 3D. And by learning how to program, trying to develop a game would be interesting as I would be creating something that I like, along with learning how games are created through coding. Also, due to the lack of experience in game development creating a 2D would be ideal, as not only is it easier to make, but it would also be a great introduction to learn the fundamentals.</p>

                <p> to why I specifically want to build this game, through recently conducted research I have found that developing a 2d game would be the best project as a beginner to game development. As it is much less complicated than 3d games which would require additional processes such as 3d modelling. Additionally, by implementing a pixel game style would make it easier to create game assets such as the player model, and also provide a minimalistic and simple game that is appealing in the top-down shooter genre.
                    </p><br>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>As mentioned, the project is a 2D top-down shooter game similar to games such as “Enter the Gungeon” and “Nuclear Throne”. The objective of the game is to collect as many ‘boxes’ whilst fighting hordes of enemies and dodging returning fire. By collecting these ‘boxes’ the player will be accumulating points and will also receive a new random weapon from a pool. As points continue to increase so will the rate at which enemies spawn and how difficult they will be to kill. The main selling point of this game is that it is fast-paced and its repeatability. As players continue to play in order to achieve a new personal best in terms of points by collecting boxes whilst also killing and dodging incoming enemy fire provides the audience the experience of a bullet-style game. and as the game continues to become harder the more points accumulated, it makes breaking one’s personal record even more rewarding and satisfying. The final developed game should include the features:
                    </p><br>

                </ul>
                <br><h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
                <p>To develop the game is mainly Unity, which is a free 2D/3D engine that provides a system for designing games and or applications. This software will be used to program using either C-sharp or JavaScript and run the game itself. </p>

                <p> Our team plans to learn and use the programming language C-sharp to develop our game. Using unity as our main program to create most of the required items for the game such as the main menu, player movement, enemy pathing, etc. We will also be using Unity to play test our application to check for any error or bugs during the development process by creating an early test build in which will be shared to the whole team to test. The reason why our team has decided to utilise Unity instead of other game development application is because that its beginner friendly with many tutorials and also provides many features to make 2d game creation easier which can be helpful during the development of our project idea.</p>
                    
                <p> Unity has an asset store in which users can download free or paid assets that can be imported to the program, Unity does not enable users to model 2D or 3D assets. Therefore software such as Blender or Photoshop will be required to design the player, enemy, gun, effects, and map designs. Audio software such as "Ardour" or "LMMS which are both free and can be used to make the project’s in-game music.</p>
                    
                <p>Lastly, once the game has gone through multiple test-builds, fixed, and is ready to be exported, we will be exporting the game through Unity’s build function in which will create a folder with all the games contents. Anyone who has this folder will be able to then play the game by executing the exe. File located in the folder.
                    </p>
                <br><h3>Skills Required</h3>
                <p>To successfully complete the project, requires a diverse set of skills such as programming knowledge as Unity uses languages like JavaScript, C-sharp, and Boo. Known as the software developer and or game programmer, is responsible for creating the game which envisions the game designer’s design. To satisfy these skills required we plan to research and learn an intro to a programming language we plan to use such as c-sharp, as well as compile a worksheet full of tutorials on how to code specific game features.</p>
                <p>The games designer which is responsible for developing the games storyline and characters. Skill such as creativity ,analytical and storytelling skills. Which is important to keep people intrigued and make them want to play the game.</p>
                
                <p>Game Animators and artist’s skills such as illustrating, texturing, modelling, and animation are needed to create all the in-game assets like player models, map design, and effects. Fortunately, a few of our group members have experience in illustrating, texturing, and animating which can be utilise in the final project to create sprite models and such.</p>

                <p>Additionally, skills in creating music also known as audio engineer, would be helpful as it plays a big part of games. We could possibly research how to create basic sounds to be implemented into the game itself. However, it is not required as various sound assets found online can be implemented into the game and are also free to use.</p>

                <br><h3>Drawbacks</h3>
                <p>The expected drawback when undergoing this project would definitely be the lack of knowledge in game development and programming, especially when using an unfamiliar application like Unity. There will be an initial learning curve when starting off until the process becomes smoother. Bugs and errors may also arise in the process and these have to be fixed to make the game run properly as intended.</p>

                <br><h3>Implementation plans</h3>


                <br><h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>If this project is successful, it should result in a working and playable top-down shooter that is exported as a .exe in the windows platform. Most if not all features previously described should be implemented such as player model orientation, map collision and gunplay. By completing this project should also lead to increased knowledge on how to program using either JavaScript or C-sharp, the fundamentals of game development using Unity, and the other processes required to make a game like modelling, texture, and sound design.</p>
