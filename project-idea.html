                <h1>Project<span> Idea</span></h1>
                <h>2D top-down shooter game using Unity</h>
                <p>For this assessment task, groups of students were tasked to develop an IT project idea and expand on the plans our group will take in order to make the idea a reality for the upcoming assignment. The idea we plan develop is a ‘2d top-down shooter game using Unity’. The purpose of this project idea is to use programming languages such as JavaScript or C-sharp to develop a shooter game using the game development tool called Unity. The game will be a “shoot ‘em up” type in which the player combats many enemies by shooting at them whilst dodging their fire. 

                <p> game would be placed in the ‘top-down’ genre (top-down shooters specifically) and positioned to target a specific audience who like fast-paced and bullet hell style games. For example, games such as “Nuclear Throne”, “Binding of Isaac”, and “Vampire Survivors” which are popular for its difficulty, rouge-like gameplay and is also known to be some of the best-selling games in the genre.</p>
                    </p><br>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>The motivation to commence this project was mainly my interest and passion for games whether it be a shooter genre, an RPG, if it was 2D or 3D. And by learning how to program, trying to develop a game would be interesting as I would be creating something that I like, along with learning how games are created through coding. Also, due to the lack of experience in game development creating a 2D would be ideal, as not only is it easier to make, but it would also be a great introduction to learn the fundamentals.</p>

                <p> to why I specifically want to build this game, through recently conducted research I have found that developing a 2d game would be the best project as a beginner to game development. As it is much less complicated than 3d games which would require additional processes such as 3d modelling. Additionally, by implementing a pixel game style would make it easier to create game assets such as the player model, and also provide a minimalistic and simple game that is appealing in the top-down shooter genre.
                    </p><br>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>As mentioned, the project is a 2D top-down shooter game similar to games such as “Enter the Gungeon” and “Nuclear Throne”. The objective of the game is to collect as many ‘boxes’ whilst fighting hordes of enemies and dodging returning fire. By collecting these ‘boxes’ the player will be accumulating points and will also receive a new random weapon from a pool. As points continue to increase so will the rate at which enemies spawn and how difficult they will be to kill. The main selling point of this game is that it is fast-paced and its repeatability. As players continue to play in order to achieve a new personal best in terms of points by collecting boxes whilst also killing and dodging incoming enemy fire provides the audience the experience of a bullet-style game. and as the game continues to become harder the more points accumulated, it makes breaking one’s personal record even more rewarding and satisfying. The final developed game should include the features:
                    </p><br>

                </ul>
                <br><h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
                <p>To develop the game is mainly Unity, which is a free 2D/3D engine that provides a system for designing games and or applications. This software will be used to program using either C-sharp or JavaScript and run the game itself. </p>

                <p> Our team plans to learn and use the programming language C-sharp to develop our game. Using unity as our main program to create most of the required items for the game such as the main menu, player movement, enemy pathing, etc. We will also be using Unity to play test our application to check for any error or bugs during the development process by creating an early test build in which will be shared to the whole team to test. The reason why our team has decided to utilise Unity instead of other game development application is because that its beginner friendly with many tutorials and also provides many features to make 2d game creation easier which can be helpful during the development of our project idea.</p>
                    
                <p> Unity has an asset store in which users can download free or paid assets that can be imported to the program, Unity does not enable users to model 2D or 3D assets. Therefore software such as Blender or Photoshop will be required to design the player, enemy, gun, effects, and map designs. Audio software such as "Ardour" or "LMMS which are both free and can be used to make the project’s in-game music.</p>
                    
                <p>Lastly, once the game has gone through multiple test-builds, fixed, and is ready to be exported, we will be exporting the game through Unity’s build function in which will create a folder with all the games contents. Anyone who has this folder will be able to then play the game by executing the exe. File located in the folder.
                    </p>
                <br><h3>Skills Required</h3>
                <p>To successfully complete the project, requires a diverse set of skills such as programming knowledge as Unity uses languages like JavaScript, C-sharp, and Boo. Known as the software developer and or game programmer, is responsible for creating the game which envisions the game designer’s design. To satisfy these skills required we plan to research and learn an intro to a programming language we plan to use such as c-sharp, as well as compile a worksheet full of tutorials on how to code specific game features.</p>
                <p>The games designer which is responsible for developing the games storyline and characters. Skill such as creativity ,analytical and storytelling skills. Which is important to keep people intrigued and make them want to play the game.</p>
                
                <p>Game Animators and artist’s skills such as illustrating, texturing, modelling, and animation are needed to create all the in-game assets like player models, map design, and effects. Fortunately, a few of our group members have experience in illustrating, texturing, and animating which can be utilise in the final project to create sprite models and such.</p>

                <p>Additionally, skills in creating music also known as audio engineer, would be helpful as it plays a big part of games. We could possibly research how to create basic sounds to be implemented into the game itself. However, it is not required as various sound assets found online can be implemented into the game and are also free to use.</p>

                <br><h3>Drawbacks</h3>
                <p>The expected drawback when undergoing this project would definitely be the lack of knowledge in game development and programming, especially when using an unfamiliar application like Unity. There will be an initial learning curve when starting off until the process becomes smoother. Bugs and errors may also arise in the process and these have to be fixed to make the game run properly as intended.</p>

                <br><h3>Implementation plans</h3>
                <h4>Character Classes</h4>
                <p>By having a variation of character classes in our game would greatly improve the games replayability and encourage users to keep playing. It would also allow players to learn what kind of playstyle suits them by having different class abilities from a ‘assassin’ like class where the player does massive damage but have very little hp (health points), to a ‘tank’ like character where they are hard to kill but output significantly less damage to enemies. Doing so will make players want to play the game more to learn about each classes abilities and learn how to utilise it in specific scenarios in game. To implement this idea, we would need to research and learn how to code several classes which have their own specialised skill data. In addition to creating the 2d models and moving animation for each class.  </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Character Upgrades</h4>
                <p>A feature that can be implemented is a character upgrade mechanic where when a player collects a specific amount of ‘boxes’ they are given a variety of upgrades in which they can choose one upgrade that will be inherited by their in game character. The requirements of boxes needed is then increased to choose another upgrade. Having this mechanic will allow players to experience playthroughs that are different from the other as the upgrade are random, users are unlikely to have the exact same upgrade combination to previous playthroughs. Doing so will further increase replayability and ensure that players do not get bored of the same levels repeatedly. </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Map Generation</h4>
                <p>Although originally, we planned on creating a small map such as a square with a few obstacles, if we are able to research and figure out a code on how to create randomly generated maps will make the game much more interesting to play. As each playthrough will have a completely random map that the user can explore and create new strategies to progress. However, due to the lack of knowledge and experience in coding it will be difficult to implement in the game prototype. Initially we would need to complete coding the basic structure of the game such as movement, collision, gunplay, etc. in a small map before experimenting with map generation. The input of time will also be a massive factor on whether this feature can truly be implemented. </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Unique 2D Jumping Mechanic</h4>
                <p>For our 2D top-down shooter game a possible mechanic that would separate it from other similar titles in the market could come from the implementation of a vertical jump mechanic. Whilst many top-down shooters are accustomed to a dodge or roll mechanic, we are yet to come across a vertical jump. In game this would see the playable character able to jump/vault over walls in the defined play area. These walls in-game enemies would not be able to pass through, instead having to gradually walk around said obstacle giving the character time. This jump mechanic could be implemented to a specific ‘jumping class’ character or alternatively be a foundational game wide mechanic.  

                <p> the way we would implement this into the game, the most likely solution would to be by selecting a ‘jump’ input key, which when pressed commences a sequence that has both a visual and mechanical element:  </p>
                    
                <p><b>1.</b> Visual Element: given this is a 2D top-down shooter, when the jump button is pressed the sprite graphic, a small circle for this explanation, would be programmed to change into numerous incrementally larger circles (giving the visual illusion the player is jumping up), then shifting back down to the original circle size (giving the impression the character is falling back down). This animation sequence would only occur in around a 2 second window and look as if the head of the character is coming closer to the screen (viewer), mimicking the illusion of a jump from a bird’s eye view.  </p>
                    
                <p><b>2.</b> Mechanical/Functionality Element: When the jump button is pressed we will program the character sprite to be able to pass through/over certain hitboxes (such as walls and other obstacles). Alternatively, we could set a height map across the whole playing area that has different Y-axis values for certain objects (e.g. Floor = Y-axis 1, Wall = y-axis 3). We would then program the player to detect the height map by binding the jump key to allow the player to access these different height values (e.g. only can access y-axis 1 - but when jump key is actioned player can access y-axis 3 momentarily. This, paired with the visual animation will give the player the impression that their character has just jumped over/onto the given obstacle.  </p>

                <br>

                <h4>Character Customisation Mechanic</h4>
                <p>A customization feature for each character in our game would allow us to differentiate ourselves from similar top-down shooters out there. Through allowing users to customize their character they can develop personal touches to the avatar, making them more playable. The extra consumables could have no direct impact on the game and how it’s played while others could have certain attribute that help users through difficult levels. Such as a baseball cap for example which could give the character a speed boost allowing them to complete the level faster thus earning a higher score. Conversely other customizations could have no effect in gameplay and is purely for player satisfaction. Having both options would allow our top-down shooter to possess a unique feature. Regarding the implementation of this feature a menu would need to be created label customization, which would pull up an array of selection. Displaying the variety of skins and other aesthetic options, with blocked or yet to be unlocked items chained. Once equipped depending on the item it would either boost character stats or remain as an aesthetic feature for user enjoyment. </p>
                <p><a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAPIWJJ6NQI  " target="_blank">^ Video example aid for A3</a>  <br></p>
                <br>
                <h4>Ageing Mechanic</h4>
                <p>This game mechanic introduces players into a looping system that has the character upon death enter an ageing mechanic. This was taken out of a game which similarly implemented element being Sifu. The brawler style fix camera game has players battling against a variety of enemy groups with the character starting in their teens. The more times players approach death, the game takes an interesting spin, allowing the character to age, coming back stronger with less health. Thus, introducing a balancing mechanic that utilizes replay ability as the same level can be approached at different “age” save points, developing additional tactics to beat the game. However, as the main story is not yet developed, it is hard to vision if this will be implemented for the team’s game. </p>

                <br>
                <h4>2.5D Game Style</h4>
                <p>Although the group agreed to make a 2D top-down shooter style game, a unique 2.5D style could be considered as a selling point for the final product. An example of such a project is “The Last Night”, a futuristic 2.5D game, incorporating pixel and environment textures to provide a fresh look. This builds the overworlds lore, highlighting exploration in 3D using 2D assents. If this idea is used, more research on which program could integrate the 2.5D style should be investigated. As camera angles and perspectives should be studied to make assets appear alive, pixelated motion of character and world textures should be developed as well. </p>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4IPBiB7SF4 " target="_blank">^ Video example aid for A3</a>  <br></p>
                <br>
                <h4>Loot Box System</h4>
                <p>A possible gameplay mechanic would involve the boxes that the player would pick up within run. I would contain one from a pool of many weapons that have unique gameplay elements such as different weapon types (eg. melee, pistols, rifles, single shots), burn damage, even different projectile types, or other aspects that the group may come up with. This item drop system may be extended to character abilities that can modify or add to the selected class/character that the player has chosen before the run. This will allow for the possibility for combinations of abilities and weapons that will feel satisfying when using them together. Also, by having these aspects of randomness/rng, it will bring the game more replay value for the player to come back and explore the possibilities.</p>
                
                <br><h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>If this project is successful, it should result in a working and playable top-down shooter that is exported as a .exe in the windows platform. Most if not all features previously described should be implemented such as player model orientation, map collision and gunplay. By completing this project should also lead to increased knowledge on how to program using either JavaScript or C-sharp, the fundamentals of game development using Unity, and the other processes required to make a game like modelling, texture, and sound design.</p>
