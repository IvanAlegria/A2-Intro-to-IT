<h>These were the questions and answers that were asked During the Interview, some questions were modified.</h>
<h3>Topic: Web Development</h3>

<p>Q: “How did you first get involved/interested in IT and then Web Development?”
<br>A: “I got my first computer, which was the Amstrad CPC6128, I played games on it and got magazines that allowed me to type out the code from it to the computer. I then saved up and upgraded to an Amiga 500 after using it at a friend’s house. I also used it mainly for games, but I also created pixel graphics and played around with audio. Eventually I upgraded to an Amiga 1200, which was a more powerful model that I used until the year 2000. I eventually ended up doing web development after being selected for a course by Rotary in Shepparton, the course then landed me a placement at Shepparton newspaper which was also one of the first regional ISPs at the time. My first time doing HTML was actually my first day of employment. After learning HTML for the job I kept up with the changes in HTML, and when Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) came along that made my life so much easier as far as web development.
</p>

<p>Q: “What are the key responsibilities of a web developer? If any, who do you often collaborate with during a project?”
<br>A: “Yep, so our business, I’m the director of the business as well, so I wear many hats, but just using the web developer context, my key things that I care about, and I got interested in very early, so back in ‘98 was accessibility and usability, so I always try to guide the client to make sure that their site is going to meet accessibility requirements because that’s legal requirement in Australia anyway, and then just from my own knowledge to my key value proposition for a customer I think is the long term experience I had developing websites and knowing what is possible, so being able to guide them beyond what they think, or what they know about web and what they want, to give them something that exceeds their expectations and makes life easier for them.”</p>

<hr>

<p>A: Oh, just one caveat, we don’t do brosure-ware sites, we build functional websites with application-like functionality, so that gives a little bit more context on that.
<br>Q: What sort of functions?
<br>A: “So, some of it are standard types of functionality, it could be user management, but not the users on the website, things we’ve done were CRM integration, we do a lot of API integration work, we decouple websites, so we have a content management backend and then a Javascript front end, a lot of it is complex workflows around contents leveraging their content so that they create content once, but they could reuse it in multiple places, where as a brochure-ware site is just creating a page and that’s it, they can’t really leverage that content other than maybe site search or something.”
</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: “What are the biggest perks and challenges you face working in this area of IT?”
<br>A: “Perks probably didn’t start until I started my own business, because in every workplace I was at before then, I was the sole person responsible for doing web development, I was lucky that most of my managers gave me huge amounts of freedom to just lead it in the direction I thought it should go, so I assumed you’ve looked at my Linkedin page, or at least Anin has, so I was at ‘Shepparton Internet’, which became Fersons Media, then I moved to Melbourne because a lot of the clients we had were Melbourne based, so I was doing websites for RMIT, one of the first online training courses that they did, which won an award, when I left that business, I went to work at Wesley College, and I wrote a CMS myself, and that CMS survived I think for five years after I left the business, and if you looked at what my manager gave me as my recommendation on Linkedin, he didn’t say anything like that when I was there, but I was amazed at what he wrote about my ideas about content management, everything was way ahead of their time back then, so perks wise when you have your own business that’s given me the flexibility, we haven’t always had the opportunity to say no to clients, but I think that’s one of the biggest things, especially if any of you take that entrepreneur route, or become a freelancer, getting to the point where you can say no to clients is very important for you to be able to select the right types of clients, you don’t want to just say yes to every type of work because some clients are very painful to deal with, and finding that niche that you can collaborate effectively with where you benefit each other is far more beneficial than just taking every piece of work that you can, because it can end up costing you more, more through reducing the profitability of each of your clients, so when you can select the right clients you get a better profitability matrix, and so it’s better for your business and in our case, it has allowed us, whether it’s things like Covid and other times where, because we’ve never advertised, all of our work has been word of mouth, we’ve had periods of time where we don’t have any work for two months and it doesn’t matter, we’ve got money in the bank, so we can weather it.”
</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: “So were there any challenges that you faced while working in the IT industry?”
<br>A: “So, the biggest challenges were, I’ve always looked quite youthful for my age and especially when I was the sole person responsible, in some workplaces there’s this problem, it happens everywhere, there’s this problem of internal people often don’t get listened to, they need the voice of an external “expert” to come in and tell them what they should do, even when the internal person has that knowledge and they’re telling you exactly the same thing, so I did come across that were I got shoehorned into committees where the committee is to make the decision, but it was basically me leading the committee anyway, it was just needless bureaucracy so that they felt comfortable that there was some “leadership” over the process, even though in that case luckily the person who was the chair of the meeting said, “you’re the expert here, you can pretty much lead the way things go”, most of those challenges have been around the perception of, it wasn’t this term but you know “he’s just a kid, he doesn’t know anything” sort of thing, but the reality is no one knew much about the internet back then anyway, I knew lots of people at the time that I started in the industry who left school, went and worked in an industry and are quite successful now without having to go to university or anything, that’s actually one of the huge benefits for me at the time that I was, I didn’t have to go to university, I had no Hecs debt or anything coming out and going into work, which was really good, but yeah, I think the biggest challenge is getting to the point where internal or external customers, you know, if you’re working at a workplace vs working with external customers, trust you enough that you know what you are doing, I guess, and part of that when you’re running a business, you have to show them somehow, I don’t know how we do it, we just, you know, you talk the talk and walk the walk really, and that’s the word of mouth thing that really helps that, any client that comes to you via word of mouth is already pre-qualified, it’s much easier to land that type of client than trying to advertise or call people.”
</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: what do you feel like the most important skill for that line of work whether that be like a hard skill like a specific coding language or a soft skill like how you manage relations with people?
<br>A: “So, web development has become really broad so there’s so many skill sets in it, depending on what level you do it in, you can’t do it as one person anymore. If you’re doing small brochure-ware websites it’s fine, but if you’re doing enterprise level sites you need more than one person. I would say soft skills are the most important in probably any job unless you have a job where you don’t have to work with other people because being able to build and effective working relationship with the people you work with is the key thing, if you can’t have disagreements effectively, they are not going to work with you again in the future. You have to be able to deliver on what you say you can deliver, so that’s a mix of tech and soft skills, you have to know what you can effectively promise to someone and actually deliver on it.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: how are you keeping up with the latest developments of web development?
<br>A: “That’s really hard, conferences are one really good way to do that, but what happened with me is that I’m quite involved in a large mentoring effort. Drupal is the main web tool I work with, although we’re transitioning a little bit. I’m fairly heavily involved with the mentoring effort of that globally, so at conferences now I lead the first time contributors workshops, to help people who’ve never contributed to druple, because it’s open source, to get involved in contributing, and what’s that meant over time is that when I go to conferences now I don’t actually get to go to many sections, because I’m busy organising around all that stuff. What that did allow me to do is to get to a lot more conferences that I would have otherwise, because I often receive grants to help for the costs of travel, and everything. So what do I do mostly is, we standardised on one tool largely for most of the business’ lifetime, so standardising on Drupal meant that one of the first things we would try and figure out if a random client came to us is that what are you trying to build, is Drupal a good fit for that? And being willing to tell them that mayble Drupal is not the right tool is valuable as well. There has been clients that come and I’ve said “I don’t think this is the right thing for where you are in your business”, like if they’re are a new business, they don’t necessary want to spend a lot of money and they can often achieve something that will… They want to prove the business before they spend a lot of money on a website, so for anyone with commerce now, I recommend they go to something like shopify, although Drupal can do commerce, but the only instance that I would go to something like that is where you have very custom requirements that are met by something like shopify, we’ve standardised on a tool that we use and so that partitions down the amount of stuff we need to learn quite a lot, because we’re just learning what’s the changes and what’s new in Drupal, now that we’ve moved to decoupled websites, we’ve also standardised heaps of decoupled options, so we’ve standardised on Nuxt, we just stayed in those two columns and try to keep the rest of what’s new there, and don’t worry about everything else, where a quite small company, there’s only two of us most of the time and so we’ve standardised, we don’t have internal graphical design because quite often the clients we get are quite large and they have internal people who do graphic design already and if they don’t, our thinking is that if we had someone internally who did graphic design, they would have to be doing graphic design and web development and a whole bunch of other stuff, it’s just much better for us and much better for the client in the case where they don’t have to graphic design that we subcontract someone who does graphic design as their primary role because they’re going to give a better result, both Stewart and I in the business have done that role throughout our web development life time, we’ve both done basically all things you can do to do with web development at some point in time.”

<h3>Topic: specific day to day of Person</h3>

<p>Q: What kind of work do you do and what does that entail?
<br>A: “It would really depend on the particular project it’s usually a mix of either actually doing web development, so I kind of have, I mean I’ve got all the roles, but the three key main things I do is client liaisons, so I would be in meetings with clients trying to collect requirements or update where the project is at or anything like that, I’m also the technical architect, so I’m massaging those requirements into technical specifications, or build plans for the web build and then the other thing I do is the back end build so I do a lot of the building of functionality that we need in Drupal, they are the three primary things, but then I also do front end development as well, but Stewart is probably our primary heavy lifter in front end in complex front end stuff anyway. That probably covers it.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: “You mentioned Stewart, how many people work amongst your inner circle team?”
<br>A: “It’s just me and Stewart at the moment, it depends on the project, but we have subcontracted people for long term projects. We’ve done large projects where Deloitte
contracted us to basically help them build up their own internal Drupal team and for that we subcontracted three other people I think, so we had five of us, but what we figured out is that for all that extra money coming in to the business, a huge chunk of it was going out paying the contractors, because they worked at a high rate, it doesn’t really make sense to do that all the time so we kind of, we went back to just the two of us.”
</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: “Is most of your work individual-based or collaborative?”
<br>A: “For me at the moment, I’m in the planning phases of projects at the moment, so I’m spending a huge amount of time in meetings, like last week I spent probably 1 to 3 hours per day in meetings, also you have to be aware that I don’t work Wednesdays normally, so that’s  another thing about having your business, you have that flexibility to decide to do that and also, our latest client I was very upfront about that at the start of the project, and they were ok with that so that was really good. Normally Stewart and I, pre-covid time we used to use what’s called a service office, so we would work together in the same room once a week, but when we had that Deloitte project because, that went for a year, we were paying for this service office that we never used, and we decided to cut it off, Stewart lives in Ballarat as well, so travelling to Melbourne, or me travelling to Ballarat takes up a fair chunk of time, if we were to do it often. A couple of times a year we would go to one of each other’s places or somewhere and work together for a day or a couple of days, but we’re also pretty effective that we do meetings online using tools like this (Zoom) everyday when we can, because sometimes Stewart is full time on a client for a day, so we don’t do a meeting those days, because he’s just going to say, I’m doing work with this client. But Stewart and I have been working together for so long now. I started Reality Loop in the middle of 2011 and Stewart joined in September, so 3 months later, so that’s 11 years ago. So we know each other’s strengths and weaknesses, we know where we need to support each other, and so can get stuff done mostly.”
</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: “And most of that happens at home just using the tools online”
<br>A: “yeah, I work from home now, and Stewart does as well, so he’s got a room at his house that’s like a home office as well. “
</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: “Do you have a decision making process at work you follow?”
<br>A: “I guess it would depend on the nature of the decision if it’s a business related decision it’s me. The structure of our business is that I’m the sole director, I’m the founder of the business, but I gave Stewart an equal share hold of the business, so he gets an equal share of profits because we both work just as hard as each other, but I’m still the sole director, so I have the final say in business decisions, but I respect his opinion, so I often will talk to him about business decisions that I think have a large impact on us, but most of the financial decisions, most of the dealing with clients stuff, like he’s not interested in doing day to day dealings with clients, so I just do all that. It will either be I make a decision or Stewart and I talk and we come to a collaborative decision pretty much.”
</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: “So in your opinion how do you maintain a healthy work-life balance?”
<br>A: “So a large part of that has been working only 4 days a week and I don’t expect stewart to be available at anytime of the day and for me, we us an asynchronous communication method mostly so, we’ll send a message and if we want a voice meeting, we’ll just send a message and if we want a meeting them we’ll send a “meeting question mark” and if he doesn’t reply, then obviously you can’t have a meeting so, we can talk about it after the recording time, I have an interesting diet that means that I don’t have a large break, so I finish work pretty much when I pick the kids up from school, and I do weights and all sorts of stuff after that, so I’m pretty much finish work around 3:00 most days, I might do another hour after that if there’s meetings being scheduled, but we’re both got flexibility, we’ve both trust each other to do work when it needs to be done, and we don’t have a specified leave time, Stewart would ask me if he’s ok that he’s away a certain week, and likewise for me.”
</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: “Motivations behind starting your own company - Reality loop?”
<br>A: “The biggest driver was three years in a row, Monash University forgetting to renew my contract and Jane going, “hey you’re not getting paid, what’s going on?” So I just got sick of it and at that point in time, you’ve been there working in the same roll for three years, they should be putting you on as a full time employee anyway, I was doing a lot of moonlighting at that time as well, and I just spoke about it with Jane, my wife, and she was very supportive of me trying to start a business, so I did.”
</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: “was it harder or easier than you thought?”
<br>A: “I don’t think it was harder, I mean, I didn’t have to appease management, I just had to appease my client, and the clients, if they are employing you, they are trusting you to get stuff done in the large part, I was very lucky, early on I had an NGO in South Korea where I picked up the work for a multilingual website with a contractor who was in South Korea from America, and we had a really great repore, we were doing four hour Skype calls everyday, talking through stuff, and working through stuff, so I was doing work on a government site after hours just before I switched over to business that continued with that client, that was part of the reason that I was doing day work and then getting home and working for hours and being exhausted, so it was like this doesn’t make sense, I could be earning more money, working for myself, so they key thing was that it wasn’t harder, as I earnt basically more money the first year of doing business and it being profitable since day one.”
</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: “As a business CEO, which sector do you usually put the most resources in?”
<br>A: “We don’t really advertise, so we don’t really do it, most of our clients now are a mix of government or education, they have been historically. But most of the time we get contacted, we get invited to tend for stuff, I don’t typically go looking for tenders to apply for because, I don’t like tending to apply for because I don’t like the tender process, so if we get invited to tender, I take that as us being somewhat pre qualified for the position, so I will invest the time, like the current job that we’re on almost dropped out, and we were like “please don’t don’t drop out”, so I did a power two days of pulling something together, and we got selected. The one before that was one we had a pre-existing relationship with and they invited us to tender, but they said that that was the best tender that they’ve ever seen as far as a response. If you are good enough at your work, you won’t have to invest a lot in segment, unless you’re trying to break into a new segment. I think, our long term goal is to work on products so that will be moving away from client work.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: “What’s the best advice for starting a career in the IT industry?”
<br>A: “If you don’t like change, don’t do it, because this industry changes all the time. If you know you really want to do IT, but you don’t care what, I would look into network management, it is somewhere where you don’t have to interact with a lot of people and it’s a high pay area. You’ve got to be the type of person who likes to continuously learn throughout your life time, it’s not a job where you can just learn something once and that’s all you need to know for the rest of your life.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: “What do you look for in new employees?”
<br>A: “So our biggest thing when we have looked for employees is just look for someone that we’ve feel like we can work with, so it’s really about personality, because we had a big advantage in that we used to run the local meet ups for Drupal, so we already knew some idea of the technical ability of most people that we interviewed, so we were purely looking for someone who would fit with our team because we already know we don’t want to work ourselves by dogs, so we want to find someone who would be happy to work at roughly the same pace and, we will be able to day to day get along with. I think the people is more important than anything else, any of the technical stuff can be learnt if the person has enough curiosity to learn.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: “Do you have any possible regrets joining the IT industry?”
<br>A: “No, I mean I left school two weeks before year 12 exams, I am one of the leaders in Australia in my particular field and well respected in the international community, I’m pretty happy.”</p>
