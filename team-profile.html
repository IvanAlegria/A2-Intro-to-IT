                <p>Ron Shaharit, s3185905:

Hi everyone, thank you for taking the time to look at my profile. My Name is Ron Shaharit. I am originally from Israel and I moved to Australia at the end of 2009. Hebrew is my first language and English is my secondary language. I am a Fourth-year student studying Bachelor of Engineering Civil and Infrastructure (Honours) at RMIT University. I have also completed my first internship as a Vocational Student Engineer at Port of Melbourne. For the last eight years, I have been working as a basketball referee and from the beginning of 2021, I work as a high school maths tutor. My interest in IT started when my friends were teaching me about computer parts. From learning about the externals of how laptops and computers work, I developed an eventual interest in learning code
