                <h2>Group Activity</h2>
<br>
                <h3> What went well?</h3>
                <p>Every meeting that we had was organized in a very sensible way. We took turns to organize meetings rather than one person taking all the load. Every meeting had agendas and we talked about how far we have worked on our parts. We used websites to see our availability & organize a meeting time. The due date of the assessment made it possible to relax and target for perfection rather than make it quick and just skim through work. It was made possible by one of the teammates to convince an IT (Information Technology) personnel to do the interview the interview was on time, and we faced minimal problem recording the interview (There was some background noise & the zoom disconnected suddenly) But nonetheless it was overall a great interview from my perspective. The questions were categorized. The answers were insightful. The good thing about the group is the communication. Some people might find it hard to talk to new people, but we did not find it to be a problem. Everyone took part to ask questions in the interview & in general meetings all of us talk about how they are doing with their part of the work. Everyone was in cooperation of helping each other & was polite enough to ask if anyone needed any help with their part. Everyone was continually active in teams as well uploading files, or any content related to assignment. All above everyone was very honest about the work. If someone had problem doing their part on time, they were honest about it.

                <br>
                  <h3>What could be improved: </h3>
                  <p>One of the problems were finding time for everyone to attend meeting. One of the team members was on work break while attending meetings & so that was problematic for everyone to join the meeting on time. Fortunately, every meeting was recorded so anyone who might fail to join in could later watch what was discussed throughout the meeting. Other than that, everyone was doing their part but not submitting on the collaborative document or not uploading beforehand the meeting. Teammate needed to be told to upload their work. Lastly teammates were very invested in their own work rather than working as a team. This points a double-edged sword. Even though all of us was trying to perfect our own parts it left us not to check anyone else’s work. Leaving every part as a solo work. </p>
<br>
                  <h3>Surprising Elements: </h3>
                  <p>The interview was very quick to set up and we did not do any retakes to make any improvements. It was very surprising since it was the first time, we did it. We learned a lot from each other about individual concept and insight. </p>
<br>
                  <h3>Things we learn about the group: </h3>
                  <p>Everyone in the group had weakness and strength.</p>

                <h2>Individual Reflections</h2>
<br>
                <h3>Anin</h3>
                <p>From my perspective I think we did a great job working as a group. The workload was divided well amongst everyone, and members actively took on extra responsibilities to help others. Everyone knew exactly what needed to be done and put a lot of effort into each of their individual tasks. Meetings were consistently held, and the rotating meeting leader made them much more streamlined and manageable. During meetings everyone contributed and had great inputs and ideas to push overall report progress. No one completely ignored deadlines and were honest and straightforward about their issues or concerns. The group also fostered a supportive environment which made me always feel supported. Nonetheless, I think we could have improved on our team communication outside of meetings (e.g. messaging on teams), and also our attendance to meetings given this sometimes would vary. In all, I think we collectively possessed quite varied strengths and weaknesses but were able to use this to our advantage to foster a really great group chemistry and produce a balanced and detailed report. It was an absolute pleasure working with this team and I look forward to working with them on future projects.

                <h3>Ron</h3>
                <p>Throughout the weeks covering the construction of the report, I believe that the project was completed well. This can be shown based on the workload distribution. Each team member was responsible for two main elements with additional group activity sections such as a team meeting delivery, report formatting as well as interviewing our IT professional. Although, some sections such as industry data, IT technologies and project idea may have needed additional work time for researching and writing said topics. Therefore, going into assignment 3, time-based allocations should be talked amongst the group to develop a workplan ahead of time. Overall, the soft deadlines set in both face to face and online sessions were generally followed, with group members helping if certain sections are behind schedule. This was achieved through an implementation of an honour system, highlighting which tasks were completed and which needed more time to finish. From my perspective, this helped to push me to meet deadlines as I did not want the team to fall behind. Lastly, communication bases outside scheduled meetings could be worked upon, such as uploading individual sections for proofreading as well as a team messenger utility should be improved. I hope that the skills as well as team chemistry will be carried over to our next assignment.

                <h3>Albert: </h3>
                <p>I thought that we as a group acted well together, as everyone was well organised, and each section was divided up equally to lighten the assignment. The regular meetings held were a great way to keep track of everyone’s progress and help clear up any queries or doubts we had about the assignment. Although at times meeting attendance would take a hit; finding a time that suited everyone was a challenge and would need to be improved on in the future. Nevertheless, I believe everyone benefited from each meeting one way or another. I also found that the group consistently hit soft deadlines made by the collective which helped keep us on track with the workload. Although I do think we could have been better prepared during the final reporting section as everyone was focused on their own tasks and that did delay bringing everything together, however I think a little more planning would have resolved this issue easily. However, to find an interview on time was probably the most surprising thing to have happened. I do believe that everyone brought out the best in each other to help us complete this assignment, I had a blast working with this group and hope that we continue to push out great work in future assignments.

                <h3>Altaf: </h3>
                <p>The groupwork was better than any other group I have worked with. Everyone did their part according to what we have talked about in the meetings. It is always wished that the mates you are going to be working with have positive influence & support. I had a wonderful time working with the others. For me personally it is particularly important that we talk about how far we are in our part. In other words, communicating with each other in a remarkably effective way. I did not have any problem communicating with others. Sometimes I had trouble finding some part of the assignment confusing whereas everyone was always there to lift me up. The meeting time needed some improvement. Sometimes a group of 6 people was not able to attend at a specific time. So, someone had to sacrifice something to attend the meeting. Surprisingly enough we did our part as promised. Another surprise was that when forming a group someone will try to act alpha and take on the group. This time everyone was treated as equal. Leaving each of us to call a meeting acting as the group’s head. Finally, I only have positive feedback for the group & I’m relieved to find a group that I can work with.

                <h3>Ivan:</h3>
                <p>In my opinion, I think that the whole group did pretty well in collaborating and organising times when members are free to have project meetings. We were able to start the assessment quite early as the group was able to quickly distribute workload amongst our members. Meetings for the most part were good, we also made sure that everyone had a chance at setting up a meeting by rotating leaders. However, there were times when everyone was not able to show up in the meeting. We compensated by having one member contact the member who missed the meeting to make sure that they are up to date and know when parts are due. What can be improved, I think is actually providing evidence of work in the group, as everyone did well in writing and researching their parts. But there was no actual evidence of work. This could have been improved by having a shared file for each member’s part so that the file is constantly updated and can be seen by other members and see how other members are going with work. A surprising working in this group was that we were able to find someone to interview fast as one of our team members had connections to someone who works in the IT industry. Overall, I think that this group was well prepared and helped each other out by covering weaknesses of other members to get work done. Showing that it is important to have a group that has a wide variety of skills and have good communication to ensure that deadlines can be satisfied smoothly.

                <p>The things that went well was that we were able to fully organise meetings using When2Meet , we were able to assign even amounts of work to everyone to complete, with me doing the cloud computing section, the interview sections, and contributions to the interview questions and small parts of other sections such as coming up with a possible mechanic to implement into our project idea, we had pseudo deadlines that helped us on track. What I could have improved was time management, as it became clear how much was needed when beginning sections, such as the interview and IT technologies parts.The deadline felt like it was coming up extremely quickly which was surprising, which caused me to reorganise some plans in order to complete the assignment parts, another surprising aspect was that at one point I did not realise that the week 8 due date was in fact after the easter week break, not suring it, after checking with my group. I have learnt that it is more difficult than I had imagined to organise times that we can all meet due to each of us having our own commitments, so the few times such as during the second half of the tutorial was used to meet up.
